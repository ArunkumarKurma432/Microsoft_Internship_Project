Restaurant Rating Predictor built using Streamlit and a Random Forest Regression model! 
This app takes in key features as inputs such as: 
✅ Country and City
✅ Average cost 
✅ Cuisines served
✅ Table booking & online delivery options
✅ User reviews and ratings
…and predicts the expected rating a restaurant might receive.

Key Features:

➡️Clean and user-friendly UI built using Streamlit
➡️Used Pickle for saving and loading the model 
➡️Random Forest Regressor — chosen for its efficiency and strong performance during training
➡️Includes a wide range of cuisines and global cities
